<h3>Carol</h3>

<p>Hi, my name is Carol, I’m 51 years old.  I’ve been married to Clive for 24 years and we have three gorgeous sons, my family is my world.</p>

<p>I was diagnosed with Breast Cancer after a routine mammogram in July 2013.  I thought my world had come to an end, for the first couple of weeks I couldn’t stop crying.    Once I’d accepted it, and knew what I was going to have to go through, things became a lot easier.  I’d also experienced a very close friend’s journey with aggressive breast cancer, who I’m pleased to say is now 8 years clear ☺   Knowing what she’d been through, I considered myself lucky to have been diagnosed with DCIS (Ductal Carcinoma In Situ).  Yes, I had to have my breast removed, but it hadn’t spread into my lymph nodes, therefore I didn’t need to have chemotherapy, I was offered radiotherapy (more as a precaution I think) and decided not to have it.</p>

<p>After my surgery in September 2013, I just couldn’t wait to get my life back to normal.  I healed quickly, and was back in the swimming pool, and walking five weeks later.  I was back at boot camp and netball by early December.  Yes, the reconstructed breast feels a little foreign, it’s only been 5 months, but I’m alive!  I feel my journey has made me appreciate the little things in life and I feel a stronger and a more determined person, I wear my scars with pride, I beat cancer!</p>

<p>I would like to thank my make up Artist, Leanne Dore of <a href="http://www.illuminateme.co.nz" target="_blank">Illuminate Me</a>, she was so kind in supporting me with my photo-shoot and she did such a great job.</p>
