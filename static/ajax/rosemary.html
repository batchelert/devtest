<p>I was diagnosed with breast cancer in September 2009, just 3 days before my mother passed away from secondary cancer, stemming from her primary diagnosis of breast cancer four years earlier.</p> 

<p>My lump was on the left side and Drs told me “we have it early”, and they gave me the various options:</p>

<ul>
<li>a lumpectomy</li>
<li>or the left breast completely removed</li>
<li>double mastectomy</li>
</ul>

<p>Due to the uncertainty about the extent of the breast cancer (we did not know at this early stage if it was in the lymph nodes), so I opted to have a double mastectomy and reconstruction.</p>

<p>I had the surgery in November and then the treatment and reconstruction process started.  I was having breast implants for my reconstruction as tram flap surgery was not the best option for me.</p>

<p>First, saline implants (known as expanders) were inserted. To recreate the look and feel of a breast, doctors need skin to be able to do this- and this is where the expanders come in.</p>

<p>Each week, a nurse injects more saline into the expander through a valve uder the skin. Over the course of a number of months, the skin around the expander gently stretches, until there is enough for the permanent implant to be inserted.</p>

<p>Six weeks after surgery, I was told that I had lymph node involvement and chemotherapy was advised.</p> 

<p>Two years later with chemotherapy and Herceptin treatments out of the way, I have no regrets.  Every treatment option that I was advised to take, I took. I want to live.</p>

<p>Breast cancer runs in my family.</p>

<p>My sister, daughter and niece are the only girls in our family who have not faced breast cancer.</p>

<p>Hopefully they never will.</p>

<p>My sister is taking the coura geous step of having a mastectomy and reconstruction before she has to deal with cancer.</p>

<p>My daughter is planning the same after she has had a family. </p>

<p>Don’t be afraid of breast cancer. Face it if you have to, know that more survive than not, dig deep and find your courage.</p>

<p>Above everything else make sure you have mammograms regularly, never miss, that was how mine was discovered and I thank heaven for it daily.</p>
